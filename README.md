This project is meant to be used as a learning tool in the journey 
towards taking the OCAJP8 (Programmer 1) course from Oracle.
While it is not intended to be used as a stand-alone application,
and thus will often not be in a fully-compilable state, the code
contained within will (generally) be fully working within the scope
of its class(es).  Packages are meant to be used separately unless
specifically mentioned otherwise.  The IDE being used is Eclipse Luna.
